# Solve Classification problem using XGBoost

In this project, I built and trained classifier model using Scikit-Learn library. I used XGBoost classifier to classify.

This project has 2 datasets.
  - First model uses cardio_train.csv dataset which includes population demographic and health data. These are the input features used
      to classify whether a person has Cardiovascular disease or not (1 or 0).
    
  - Second model uses diabetes.csv dataset which includes population health data. These are the input features used
      to classify whether a person has diabetes or not (1 or 0).
